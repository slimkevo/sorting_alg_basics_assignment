Sorting Algorithms Comparison

Description:
This assignment compares Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort based on their time complexity, comparisons, and swaps. Each algorithm's efficiency and suitability for different scenarios are analyzed.

Observations:

Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort have quadratic time complexity.
Insertion Sort requires fewer comparisons but may have more swaps compared to the other two algorithms.
Each algorithm has specific scenarios where it may be preferred based on dataset characteristics.
